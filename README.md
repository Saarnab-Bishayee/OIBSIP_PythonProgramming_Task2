# ⚖️ BMI Calculator  

## 📌 Objective  
The objective of this project is to build a **BMI (Body Mass Index) Calculator** in Python that takes a user’s weight and height as input, validates them, and calculates their BMI along with the health category.  

---

## ⚙️ Steps Performed  
1. **User Input Handling** – Asked the user to enter their weight (kg) and height (m).  
2. **Validation & Exception Handling** –  
   - Checked for invalid input types (non-numeric values).  
   - Ensured values are positive and not zero.  
3. **BMI Calculation** – Applied the formula:  
   ``
   BMI = Weight / Height * Height
   ``  
4. **Category Classification** – Displayed the user’s BMI category based on standard WHO ranges.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used  
- **Python 3**  
- Exception Handling (`try-except`)  
- Conditional Statements  

---

## 🎯 Outcome  
- Successfully built a **BMI Calculator** that is safe against invalid inputs.  
- Learned **exception handling**, **validation techniques**, and **basic math operations** in Python.

🧠 **BMI Categories Reference**  

| BMI Value | Category |
|-----------|-----------|
| < 18.5 | Underweight |
| 18.5 – 24.9 | Healthy (Normal Weight) |
| 25 – 29.9 | Overweight |
| 30 – 34.9 | Obesity Class I |
| 35 – 39.9 | Obesity Class II |
| ≥ 40 | Obesity Class III (Severe) |
